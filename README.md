# JetpackProject

The objective of this app is to implement Dagger2 with the new
features that came along Android Jetpack such as Navigation, Room, ViewModel, LiveData, Paging and WorkManager alongside with the new Android Architecture Components on a app that fetches data of music albums and displays it in a list. 

Hope you enjoy this!
